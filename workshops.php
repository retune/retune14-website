						<h3>Let’s get physical with vvvv & draw with your body</h3>
						<h4>by Jochen Leinberger and Mark Lukas<br/>1 day | 26.09.2014, 10:00 – 16:00<br/>30€ (student: 24€) – <a href="http://retune.de/2014/tickets#tito-register-form">SIGN UP</a></h4>
						<p>This workshop will be inspired by the book “Prototyping Interfaces – interactive sketching with vvvv”, in which we explore the method of doing, testing and iterating to explore new ideas and concepts with functional prototypes. Because we think best way to invent the future is to prototype it! We will show you how to explore your interface idea by building it up and programming it in a rapid way.</p>
						<p>In the beginning we will show you the basic workflow of how to use vvvv and connect it to different sensors like the accelerometer of your mobile phones or Arduino based sensors. Later we will show you how to use the sensor readings and generate and manipulate real-time graphics in vvvv. At the end you can control them with your body as an input.</p>
						<p><em>Jochen Leinberger</em> studied industrial design at HfG Offenbach. He is really excited about developing and inventing new custom-made technology which is focused on solving problems, improving life and making the impossible possible. After working 7 years at MESO Digital Interiors as conceptual designer for physical interaction, he started working as UX Designer and for the conception of new products and services at T-Gallery, the Future Forum of Deutsche Telekom.</p>
						<p><em>Mark Lukas</em> studied communication design at the Hochschule für Gestaltung in Schwäbisch Gmünd. He is particularly interested in the fields of tension between digital interfaces, information design, the design of new exhibition installations, and traditional print media. Today, he is exploring these issues in his current Master Studies of Interface Design at the University of Applied Sciences Potsdam.</p>

						<h2>The superobjects Paradigm</h2>					
						<h3>Rebooting Programming as a Creative Practice</h3>
						<h4>by Alan N. Shapiro<br/>1 day | 26.09.2014, 10:00 – 16:00<br/>30€ (student: 24€) – <a href="http://retune.de/2014/tickets#tito-register-form">SIGN UP</a></h4>
						<p>This workshop introduces the superobjects coding project. The first immediate goal of my work to change the profile of who programmers are. To get away from the idea that programmers are mathematical-logical-engineering types and transform coding into a creative art form. There was a major paradigm shift in programming abouts three decade ago from the procedural paradigm to the object-oriented paradigm. What I am arguing for is a paradigm shift to a third paradigm, partly based on a further extrapolation of the shift from the first to the second paradigms. Programming so far has consisted of sending instructions to a machine or dead thing, basing software on the metaphor of the mechanistic machine. In the superobjects paradigm, software is considered semi-alive, based on the metaphor of the living organism as an information system. Code will be poetic. Existing programming is based on the logic of the discrete. Crucial in the new programming is a logic of similarities or resonances. We will also discuss the first practical applications of the superobjects paradigm in the conversational flow area of Spoken Dialog Technology and in software for dance choreography.</p>

						<p>Sometimes Twitter really looks like a participative, diffused, continuous, restless symphony in front of our eyes. But if that is just what we can see, then how does it sounds like? During the workshop we will not only give Tweets a voice, but we will try to make sense of them, a musical sense, conducting the music as a real orchestra.</p>
						<p>We will make IoT enabled devices that can interact with Twitter and use them as our instruments to perform together as the first Twitter Orchestra.</p>
						<p>While doing that we will go through the basics of physical computing and interfacing hardware with the Twitter API — IoT hands-on!</p>

						<p>For the past 2 years, BeAnotherLab has been working with an extended community of researchers, artists, and members of the public. With our initial vision to create a system to promote empathy between individuals for which uses must be codesigned with participants, we have discovered the possibilities of its uses it in a wide variety of contexts, including conflict resolution, dance, neurorehabilitation.</p>
						<p>During this two-part workshop, we will introduce participants to the technology and protocols used for the Machine to Be Another, and then discuss and experiment with new performances or use scenarios.</p>
						<p>First we will give a review of our process and of the different outcomes. The relevant scientific literature on empathy and embodiment that we based our work on will be presented. Then we will give a detailed introduction to the open-source software and hardware of the machine to be another : how to build it, how to operate it, and possible future improvements. Finally, depending on participants skills and interests, we will run a short discussion/hacking/demo session to give a hands-on experience of working with the Machine to be Another.</p>

						<h3>Lightning in the Age of Cloud-Computing</h3>
						<h4>by Julian Oliver and Danja Vasiliev<br/>5 days | 50 hours | 22. – 26.09.2014<br/>250€ (student: 200€) – <a href="http://retune.de/2014/tickets#tito-register-form">SIGN UP</a></h4>
						<p>Ask anyone how the postal system works and they would give a vaguely correct description. Few however would come close to describing how email, let alone a computer network itself, actually functions. With this lack of knowledge comes a risk; we lack the practical understanding to effectively read the infrastructural and political implications of our increased dependency on this technology.<br/>
						In this intense 5 day workshop Oliver and Vasiliev teach low level networking using only command line tools and networking hardware. In doing so, students learn not only how to create and manipulate computer networks, but also how they can be used to manipulate us.<br/>
						No prior knowledge of computer networking, programming or command line interaction is required.</p>
						<p>A small scale model of the Internet is created in class for the purposes of study with which we interact over another self-built local network. By learning about routing, addressing, core protocols, network analysis, network packet capture and dissection, students become dexterous and empowered users of computer networks. At this point students are able to read and traverse wide (the Internet) and local area networks with agility, using methods and tools traditionally the domain of experienced network administrators, hackers and security experts.</p>
						<p>In the second phase of the workshop students learn to read network topologies as political control structures, seeing how corporations and governments shape and control the way we use computer networks.</p>
						<p>Students learn to study these power structures by tracing the flow of packets as they pass over land and sea. <br/>
						Macro-economic and geostrategic speculations are made.</p>
						<p>Finally, encryption and anonymity strategies and theory are addressed, with a mind to defending and asserting the same basic civil rights we uphold in public space.</p>

						<h2>Choreographic Coding Lab</h2>
						<h4>5 days | 22. – 26.09.2014<br/>application required</h4>
						<p><a href="http://motionbank.org" target="_blank">Motion Bank</a> and <a href="http://node.vvvv.org">NODE Forum for Digital Arts</a> are inviting you to <a href="http://choreographiccoding.org/#lab-retune-2014-form" target="_blank">apply</a> for a week-long gathering of movement hackers and practitioners who will be discussing and working on projects, ideas and challenges in a peer-to-peer setting. The Lab will start before and run into the retune.14 conference (September 26th – 28th) and will be kindly hosted by <a href="http://www.hzt-berlin.de/" target="_blank">Hochschulübergreifendes Zentrum Tanz Berlin (HZT)</a>.</p>
						<p><a href="http://choreographiccoding.org/" target="_blank">Choreographic Coding Labs</a> (CCL) offer unique opportunities of exchange and collaboration for digital media ‘code savvy’ artists who have an interest in translating aspects of choreography and dance into digital form and applying choreographic thinking to their own practice. Working with patterns, structures and movement through finding, generating and applying them with results ranging from prototypes for artworks to new plug-ins for working with dance related datasets. CCLs also seek to initiate a sustainable collaborative practice among its participants encouraging ongoing exchange in an artistic research community of individuals.</p>
						<p>CCLs are an outcome of <a href="http://motionbank.org" target="_blank">Motion Bank</a>, a four-year research project of The Forsythe Company focused on the creation of digital dance scores with guest choreographers. This research involved the study, documentation and analysis of unique choreographic approaches, and the datasets and tools used behind the development of the Motion Bank scores will be made available for the CCLs which are curated in collaboration with NODE Forum as a high-level, intensive environment that maximizes interaction and exchange over a period of five days.</p>
						<p>The week will be enriched by lightning talks by members of the Motion Bank research team and network aimed to inspire and provoke participants with new perspectives and experiences. There is no fee for participation, but applicants are asked to propose starting points and ideas. The space and basic equipment will be provided. Collaborative teams involving choreographers/dancers interested in the Motion Bank research approach are very much encouraged to apply.</p>
