					<p>An essential part of retune is our diverse audience. We like to see attendees from a variety of backgrounds and professional levels. We're trying to map this to the structure of our ticket prices so everyone can contribute according to their personal capabilities. The three different ticket categories are explained below. Please pick your category truthfully.</p>

					<p><em>Student Ticket (60€):</em> If you are a student, this ticket is for you. We were students ourselves, so we know how empty your purse is most of the time. This is why we offer you the tickets at the lowest price we can. Make sure to bring your valid student card to the conference. Otherwise you will have to pay the price difference to the regular ticket at the door. By entering the code WORKSHOP-STUDENT you can get a 20% discount on the workshops.</p>
					<p><em>Regular Ticket (80€):</em> You are not a student anymore, but you are either freelancing, starting your own thing right now or are in an otherwise precarious working situation. Your purse is empty most of the time and you have never heard of a thing called "pension insurance". We've been there :)</p>
					<p><em>Professional Ticket (120€):</em> You are in a regular job or your freelancing has reached a professional level.</p>
					<p><em>Workshops:</em> Details about the workshops can be found <a href="workshops">here</a>. Workshops are not included in the conference tickets and have to be booked seperately . All the workshops run in parallel on Friday (26.09.) so you will only be able to attend one of them. If not enough people sign up for a workshop, it is possible that we have to cancel the workshop. Of course you will get a full refund in this case.<br/><strong>Students can get a 20% discount on all workshops by entering the code WORKSHOP-STUDENT</strong> (you will see the effect after you clicked "Purchase")</p>
					<p>All prices include "Umsatzsteuer" (VAT) of 19%. By buying a ticket you agree to our <a href="terms" target="_blank">Terms of Service</a>.
