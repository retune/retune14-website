					<p>An essential part of retune is our diverse audience. We like to see attendees from a variety of backgrounds and professional levels. We're trying to map this to the structure of our ticket prices so everyone can contribute according to their personal capabilities. The three different ticket categories are explained below. Please pick your category truthfully.</p>

					<p><em>Student Ticket (60€):</em> If you are a student, this ticket is for you. We were students ourselves, so we know how empty your purse is most of the time. This is why we offer you the tickets at the lowest price we can. Make sure to bring your valid student card to the conference. Otherwise you will have to pay the price difference to the regular ticket at the door.</p>
					<p><em>Regular Ticket (80€):</em> You are not a student anymore, but you are either freelancing, starting your own thing right now or are in an otherwise precarious working situation. Your purse is empty most of the time and you have never heard of a thing called "pension insurance". We've been there :)</p>
					<p><em>Professional Ticket (120€):</em> You are in a regular job or your freelancing has reached a professional level.</p>
					<p><em>Workshops:</em> There will be a variety of workshops offered on Friday, Sep 26th from 10am – 4pm. They are not included in the conference ticket and will be announced in the next weeks. They will cost between 15€ and 50€.</p>
					<p>All prices include "Umsatzsteuer" (VAT) of 19%. By buying a ticket you agree to our <a href="terms" target="_blank">Terms of Service</a>.
