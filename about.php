					<h1>about retune</h1>
						<p>As increasing parts of our lives are influenced and ruled by technology, its relationship towards humans, society and culture needs to be renegotiated.</p>
						<p>From 26. - 28. September 2014 the retune conference brings together for the third time artists, designers, technologists as well as researchers and scientists to inspire interdisciplinary thinking and making. This annual gathering of international creative minds seeks to explore, shape, and critically question the future of living, working, and expressing with technology. </p>
						<p>Within a three days conference international thinkers and practitioners will give inspirational talks and key note speeches; participants will gain further practical experiences in workshops and have the chance to discuss and connect with like-minded creatives from various interdisciplinary fields.</p>
					<h1>inside the mirror</h1>
					<img class="img-responsive" src="img/moods.png" /><br/>
						<p>Mirrors allow us to look at the world and ourselves from the outside, enable us to see things otherwise hidden. Giving us the chance to learn something about us and our environment. 
						Today's mirrors are not made of glass and metal but from silicon. The digital world is like a mirror-world, reflecting events, people, connections and places. Our behavior is being documented by countless data, social network activities, photos, videos and biometric data. Personal and global trends, affectations and reluctances can be analyzed. 
						It is easy to fall in love with the wonderland in the mirror and our virtual self that is easy to reshape.<p>  
						<p>Reflections can be distorted, filtered or blurred without us noticing. It looks so familiar but is yet not the same. Finding out more about the mirror is hard because it keeps distracting us with its reflections. It evades observation, showing something else instead of revealing truth about itself and hiding what lies behind.
						And in the end what the mirror shows and what we see in it is not necessarily the same.</p>
						<p>How do these reflections change us? How does technology reflect back on us? How is the reflection reflected in our behavior? How does art reflect these developments?</p>
						<p>Sometimes it is hard to tell apart the real world and the reflection in the mirror, it's hard to find the way out of the house of mirrors. Everything seems blurry and we're left alone looking at ourselves in the reflection of our computer screens.</p>
